## Overview

Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNAN) are designed to be fully interpretable, providing both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model.

### Requirements
* Python 3.9
* PyTorch 1.0.0
* PyTorch Geometric 1.0.0
* scikit-learn 0.20.0
* numpy 1.15.4
* scipy 1.1.0
* pandas 0.23.4

# Run
To run an experiment, set the parameters in the run.sh file , then run bash run.sh
